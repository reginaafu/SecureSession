Node.js Authentication Application

This Node.js application demonstrates a simple authentication system with user roles and a specific task that only authorized users can perform. It includes user registration, login, and session management.

Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with a username and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in using their credentials.
- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed for authentication.
- **Unique Client Identifiers**: Each client is assigned a unique identifier using cookies.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: The first registered user gets 'admin' privileges, while others are regular users.
- **Protected Task**: A message posting feature is available only to 'admin' users.
